<h2>The Creater</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Jolissa and I am the creater of Jojo's crafts. I started making DIY projects when my husband, who is posted in the picture with me below, decided to buy me a circuit printer for my birthday. Ever since I started building new projects with my circuit printer, I fell in love with creating new projects for family and friends. Now I'm looking to expand and create a business where I can satisfy everyone's desired visions.  </p>
